    ## Statuses

    Statuses are once-only notifications best for streaming system information.
    Once-only means each new status replaces its previous one and only one shows
    at a time. See [throttling](/docs/3.x/functions/throttling/) for more
    information

        k$.status({
          text: 'Saved successfully',
          type: 'success'
        })

    ## Growls

    Growls are stackable, right-aligned notifications. Unlike statuses, creating
    one growl does not replace the existing one. Each Growl has its own delay 
    and styling properties. Unlike statuses, they are also dismissable like a
    modal.

        // Defaults are shown

        k$.growl({
          title: 'Greetings'
        })

    ## Statuses

    Statuses take additional parameters to allow you to hold on to them for
    longer, even forever, and style them appropriately.

        // Defaults are shown

        k$.status({
          text: 'Saved successfully', // No default
          delay: 2000, // Optional, 0 = forever
          type: 'warn', // Optional, can choose warn/success/info/error
          id: '' // Optional, for targeting with JavaScript
        })

    ## Growls

    Growls have similar flexibility.

        // Defaults are shown

        k$.growl({
          title: 'Greetings',
          text: 'We're happy to inform you your document was saved.', // Optional
          delay: 2000, // Optional, 0 = forever
          type: 'warn', // Optional
          id: 'token' // Optional
        })
