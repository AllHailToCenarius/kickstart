    While tiles appear as just styled boxes, there is some opinionated
    logic to style the containing typography in a way that makes it
    look good.

    The best way to use tiles is with standard typography tags like
    headings and paragraphs.

      Coloring tiles is pretty straightforward, only requiring you to pass in the
      desired color as a parameter. The headlines will automatically pick up the
      same styles.

          a.tile.tile-red    { @include tile(map-get($colors, red)); }
          a.tile.tile-orange { @include tile(map-get($colors, orange)); }
          a.tile.tile-yellow { @include tile(map-get($colors, yellow)); }
          a.tile.tile-green  { @include tile(map-get($colors, green)); }
          a.tile.tile-blue   { @include tile(map-get($colors, blue)); }
          a.tile.tile-violet { @include tile(map-get($colors, violet)); }
