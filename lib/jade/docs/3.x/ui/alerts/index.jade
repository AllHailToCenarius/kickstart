    Alerts are simple colored containers with opinionated type hierarchy.
    These are great for drawing attention within content or showing the 
    user notices above the page. Alerts styles are reused for showing [growls](/#{docsVersion}/ui/notifications).

    .alert
      h1.toc-exempt Attention

        <div class="alert">
          <h1>Attention</h1>
          <p>You need to change your password</p>
          <button class="button">Change Password</button>
        </div>
