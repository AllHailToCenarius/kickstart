    All images are given some baseline styling to make them work best within content.
    Here are some additional styles that are helpful in getting content and images to live 
    in harmony:

    ## Image treatments

    ### Bordered

    Bordered images help separate images and their captions from the main content.

  figure.thumbnail
    img(src="/img/mountains.png")
    figcaption Look at these beautiful mountains!

    <span>

        <figure class="thumbnail">
          <img src="mountains.png" />

      The implementation of this container is pretty simple. You'll simply
      need an image and any html element to house the content.

      To float the image right, simply follow it after the content instead of
      before.
