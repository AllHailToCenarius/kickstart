        # Anatomy of a theme

        Theming is design to be very straightforward in Kickstart as every component
        works like an extensible class.

        The easiest way to get started is to simply make a copy of
        `lib/themes/default/theme.sass` and rename it as your own.

        You'll notice `default/theme.sass` has a very repetitive structure like this:

    article.code
      :markdown
        <span>

            =some-component($args...)
              +some-component-default($args...)

  .document
    article.article
      :markdown
        This allows you to style `some-component` by either leaning on the styles
        already provided...

    article.code
      :markdown
        <span>

            =some-component($args...)
              +some-component-default($args...)
              background-color: red
              font-family: courier, monospace

  .document
    article.article
      :markdown
        ...or completely replace it with your own.

    article.code
      :markdown
        <span>

            =some-component($args...)
              background-color: red
              font-family: courier, monospoace
              padding: 20px
              margin-bottom: 15px

        # Why do it this way?

        By decoupling the default styling from the final component name, you get the
        following benefits:

        ## Keep the Kickstart core library up-to-date

        Updates to the core styles of Kickstart don't get overwritten when extending
        the component.

        ## End-user entry points remain untouched

        End users don't need to use any custom name that belongs only to the theme.
        They can flip through theme libraries and keep their library names the same.

        That's really all there is to writing a Kickstart theme. Enjoy!
