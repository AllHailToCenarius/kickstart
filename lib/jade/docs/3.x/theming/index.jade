    Theming is design to be very straightforward in Kickstart as every component
    works like an extensible class.

    The easiest way to get started is to simply make a copy of
    `lib/themes/_default.sass` and rename it as your own.

    You'll notice `_default.sass` has a very repetitive structure like this:

        =some-component
          +some-component-default

    This allows you to style `some-component` by either leaning on the styles
    already provided...

        =some-component
          +some-component-default
          background-color: red
          font-family: courier, monospace

    ...or completely replace it with your own.

        =some-component
          background-color: red
          font-family: courier, monospoace
          padding: 20px
          margin-bottom: 15px

    ## Why do it this way?

    By decoupling the default styling from the final component name, you get the
    following benefits:

    ### Keep the Kickstart core library up-to-date

    Updates to the core styles of Kickstart don't get overwritten when extending
    the component.

    ### End-user entry points remain untouched

    End users don't need to use any custom name that belongs only to the theme.
    They can flip through theme libraries and keep their library names the same.

    That's really all there is to writing a Kickstart theme. Enjoy!

    In a pure sass implementation, you could create your own theme by just
    dropping it in the theme directory. However, because this sits in a vendor
    location and probably (hopefully) not committed to your repo, it should
    make more sense to just copy the theme sass file into assets/stylesheets
    directory.

    Here's how to do this without breaking links.

    1. If using a theme not included with kickstart, add your theme to assets/stylesheets. 
       If you want to make one from scratch, you can 
       also [Copy one of the themes from the repo](https://github.com/ajkochanowicz/Kickstrap/tree/master/lib/sass/themes)
       into assets/stylesheets of your project.  
    2. In application.css.sass/scss, import that theme and any other of
       your stylesheets afterwards.
       - If using a theme included with kickstart, be sure to point to it instead of 
         kickstart_rails itself. `@import kickstart_rails/themes/themename`
    3. In your theme, make sure each import is pointing to `kickstart_rails`, not `../`
       as the base directory.
