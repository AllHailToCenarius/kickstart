    I want Kickstart to support Rails (at least) natively, but I'm not there
    yet. Any Rails experts out there want to give me a hand?

    My tool of choice for building all of Kickstart is gulp, plus a ton of
    extras. The easiest way to get started with a gulp implementation of
    kickstart is to simply
    [clone the repo](https://github.com/ajkochanowicz/Kickstrap).

    Setup instructions are in the README.md file at the repo.

    Once you have your environment up and running, you should empty the jade
    folder and use kickstart-semantic.sass. This was designed specifically as an
    empty file with everything imported in.

    Rename it to whatever you like and link to the resulting .css file in your
    html/jade
