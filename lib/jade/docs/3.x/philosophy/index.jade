    ## Philosophy

    Kickstart is an effort to carve the process of website design down to its bare essentials.

    * Content-specific classes*
      * Blocks and modifiers are assigned to mixins, never classes. This means
        instead of `.navbar` or `.list-box`, you'll define classes that define
        the content and attach the styles to them. (`.page-navigation`,
        `.news-feed`)
    * Lightweight
      * The sum total of the Kickstart product is one CSS and one JS file.
      * No jQuery required
      * By relying mostly on Sass mixins, only the CSS you need ends up in your
        project.*
    * Customizable by design
      * The design of the Kickstart compilation system encourages creating
        themes by treating component styles as extensible classes.
    * Optimized for specific use cases.
      * Kickstart recognizes three main areas for website design:
          - Applications
          - Content
          - Marketing
      * Compatible in popular backend frameworks as well as plain HTML.
    * Forward-looking
      * Each release supports the browsers that are the latest at the time of the
        release. As time goes on, new browsers become old. The Kickstart strategy
        is to let older releases become the old browser compatible options as a
        natural extension of the passing of time.
    * Endless
      * The components and functions of Kickstart 3 are just what you get out of
        the box. Kickstart is designed to integrate with third-party components
        when the standard library isn't sufficient.

  p * = Applies only to using the Sass version.
