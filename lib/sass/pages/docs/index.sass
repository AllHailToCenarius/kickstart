//  Kickstart Semantic
//  ==================
//  This is just a starter file for using Kickstrap via Sass
//  Rename this file to something you like (e.g. style.sass) and import it by
//  the same .css name from your html/jade file.

// Choose your theme
@import themes/_canary

// Now write your own Sass
